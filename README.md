## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
Foreign art enthusiasts use three-dimensional graphics conversion technology (3D imaging technology) to convert Picasso's paintings into three-dimensional models, which inspired me. I want to try to use three-dimensional graphics conversion technology to conduct deep image analysis of famous paintings in major projects and reconstruct them into 3-dimensional images, so that the pictures present a three-dimensional and dynamic image. Three-dimensional graphics conversion technology can also be combined with elements such as pixels, light and shadow to increase the layering of the picture and enrich the visual effects.
