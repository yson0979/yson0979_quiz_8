### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
Foreign art enthusiasts use three-dimensional graphics conversion technology (3D imaging technology) to convert Picasso's paintings into three-dimensional models, which inspired me. I want to try to use three-dimensional graphics conversion technology to conduct deep image analysis of famous paintings in major projects and reconstruct them into 3-dimensional images, so that the pictures present a three-dimensional and dynamic image. Three-dimensional graphics conversion technology can also be combined with elements such as pixels, light and shadow to increase the layering of the picture and enrich the visual effects.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
Stereoscopic graphics conversion technology can be implemented using JavaScript programming language, which is a web development language specifically designed for interactive. We can use the Three.js library to develop 2D to 3D famous paintings in major projects. This is a JavaScript-based 3D program library that can easily create 3D objects and scenes and set the object's lighting and materials. Three.js can interact through mouse, keyboard, drag and other events, and animate 3D images to make the artwork more vivid and three-dimensional.
This is a 3D image generated using three.js.![Alt text](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/b40959647afa44259f31dc27f3d67103.gif)
